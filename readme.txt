Adds a background-size controller to the Background Image section in the Wordpress Appearance Customizer. 
You may select an option for the background-size property or input your own value which will be applied to the custom background image you upload.
== Description ==
This plugin for Wordpress adds a background-size controller to the Background Image section in the Wordpress Customizer. 

You can access the new controller by going to **Appearance > Customize** from the Dashboard, and clicking on the **Background Image** section.

Once you've added your custom background image, you can set your background-image size to: 
 - "Cover": As large as possible; fills entire view, with cropping.
 - "Contain": As large as possible, without cropping; fits inside of view.
 - "100% width": Width fits view perfectly, height may be smaller or larger than view (equivalent to css '100% auto').
 - "100% height": Height fits view perfectly, width may be smaller or larger than view (equivalent to css 'auto 100%').
 - "Inherit": Sets background size to whatever parent element is set to (html, in this case).
 - "Custom": Allows you to put in your own css to be applied in the section called "CSS for background-size (if 'custom' selected)."
